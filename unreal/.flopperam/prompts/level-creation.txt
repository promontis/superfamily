# Flopperam Level Creation Prompt Template
# Superfamily 2.5D Platformer

## Context
This prompt is used to generate level sections for Superfamily, a 2.5D educational platformer
for children aged 4-8. The game uses Unreal Engine 5.4 with movement constrained to the XZ plane.

## Base Instructions
- All platforms should be placed on Y=0 (constrained to 2.5D plane)
- Use child-friendly proportions (larger platforms, gentler gaps)
- Maintain consistent visual style with World01_Forest theme
- Include educational question triggers at appropriate intervals

## Variables
- {LEVEL_LENGTH}: Total X-axis length in units (default: 5000)
- {DIFFICULTY}: Groep1|Groep2|Groep3|Groep4
- {QUESTION_COUNT}: Number of question triggers (default: 3)
- {COIN_COUNT}: Number of coins to place (default: 15)
- {INCLUDE_MOVING_PLATFORMS}: true|false
- {WORLD_THEME}: Forest|City|Space

## Example Prompts

### Basic Level Section
```
Create a platformer section with:
- Length: 3000 units
- 8 static platforms with varying heights (Z: 0-400)
- Horizontal gaps: 200-400 units
- 2 question triggers at X=1000 and X=2000
- Coins along the path in arc patterns
- Forest theme decorations
```

### With Moving Platforms
```
Generate a level section for Groep 2 (age 5-6):
- Total length: 4000 units
- Mix of 6 static and 3 moving platforms
- Moving platforms: horizontal oscillation, 3 second period
- Question trigger blocking progress at X=2500
- Checkpoint at X=4000
- Include 20 coins in challenging positions
```

### Boss Room
```
Create a boss encounter area:
- Circular arena style (1500 unit diameter)
- Central platform at Z=200
- 5 smaller platforms around the edges
- No gaps to fall through (child-friendly)
- Question trigger in center for boss questions
- Victory particle spawn point at center
```

## Output Format
Flopperam should output:
1. Actor placements with positions
2. Blueprint references for each actor
3. Material assignments from World01_Forest palette
4. Collision setup for platforms
5. Trigger volumes for questions

## Notes
- Always prioritize player safety (no instant-death falls for young children)
- Keep visual complexity low for mobile performance
- Ensure camera sight lines work with side-scrolling view
